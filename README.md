# 30-day smart contract personal challenge

I'm challenging myself to code one smart contract a day for the next 30 days. I'll start by storing simple math and physics constants and gradually tackle complex data structures and scientific applications.

Each day, the goal is to focus on a new concept, getting a bit harder as I go. By the end, I hope to have a good grasp of Solidity and understand how it can be used in scientific fields.

Using the following:
* Base Sepolia for testnet deployment
* Remix IDE for development
* Coinbase wallet

For any question or information - message me on Farcaster @mani
